## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to work with background position to form a wave image in the sections contents, I also learned media queries to leave the site responsive for mobile I didn't start with mobile first but I will test in my next project. Using media queries it's a simple way to adapt a site where the users can see the site in a mobile screen you can define the screen size and adpat all the contents for a better view.


Example: 

@media (max-width:768px) {


{
